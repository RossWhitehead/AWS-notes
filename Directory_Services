# AWS Directory Services

## AWS Managed Microsoft AD

* Fully managed Microsoft Active Directory in the cloud. 

## AD Connector

* Allow your on-premises users to log in to AWS applications and services with their Active Directory credentials. 
* Join Amazon EC2 instances to your existing Active Directory domain.
* Connector redirects AD requests to on-premise.
* AD Connectors and your on-premises AD domains have a 1-to-1 relationship. That is, for each on-premises domain, including child domains in an AD forest that you want to authenticate against, you must create a unique AD Connector.
* AD Connector cannot be shared with other AWS accounts. If this is a requirement, consider using AWS Managed Microsoft AD to Share your directory. 
* AD Connector is also not multi-VPC aware, which means that AWS applications like WorkSpaces are required to be provisioned into the same VPC as your AD Connector.

## Simple AD

* Low-cost directory with basic Active Directory compatibility.
* Supports Samba 4â€“compatible applications, or you need LDAP compatibility for LDAP-aware applications.
* Two sizes:
    * Small - Supports up to 500 users (approximately 2,000 objects including users, groups, and computers).
    * Large - Supports up to 5,000 users (approximately 20,000 objects including users, groups, and computers).

## Cognito

* If you develop high-scale SaaS applications and need a scalable directory to manage and authenticate your subscribers and that works with social media identities.

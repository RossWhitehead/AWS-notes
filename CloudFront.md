## Restict access to S3 (Origin Access Identities)

* Create a special CloudFront user called an origin access identity (OAI) and associate it with your distribution.
* Configure your S3 bucket permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access the files in your bucket and serve them to your users. Make sure that users canâ€™t use a direct URL to the S3 bucket to access a file there.

## Restrict access to ALBs

* Configure CloudFront to add a custom HTTP header to requests that it sends to the Application Load Balancer.
* Configure the Application Load Balancer to only forward requests that contain the custom HTTP header.
* s(Optional) Require HTTPS to improve the security of this solution.

# S3

* Simple Storage Service.
* 11 9's (99.999999999) durability.
* Designed for 99.5% to 99.99% availability.

### Limits

* Each object, maximum of 5TB.
* Single PUT is limited to 5GB.
* Use muiltipart upload for objects > 100 MB.

### Storage Classes

* S3 Standard
    * General purpose store for frequently accessed data.
* S3 Intelligent-Tiering
    * Data with unknown or changing access patterns.
* S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access)
    * Long-lived less frequently accessed data.
* S3 One Zone-IA
    * Long-lived less frequently accessed data.
    * Same durability as Standard, but lower availability (99.5%)
* S3 Glacier
    * Long-term archive
* S3 Glacier Deep Archive
    * Long-term archive
* S3 Outposts
    * Store S3 data on-premise.

### Consistency Model

* Strong read-after-write consistency.

### Pricing Model

* Storage costs
    * can vary significantly by storage class.
* Request and Data Retrieval costs (Data retrieval from IA and  Glacier archives)
* Data transfer costs, except for:
    * Data transferred in from the internet.
    * Data transferred between S3 buckets in the same AWS Region. 
    * Data transferred from an Amazon S3 bucket to any AWS service(s) within the same AWS Region as the S3 bucket (including to a different account in the same AWS Region).
    * Data transferred out to Amazon CloudFront (CloudFront).

### Intelligent-Tiering Archive configuration

### S3 Glacier

* Files are stored as archives.
    * An archive can be up to 40TB.
* Archives are grouped in vaults.
* Event notifications can be enabled for the following job completion events:
    * Archive Retrieval Job Complete.
    * Vault Inventory Retrieval Job Complete.

### S3 Access Points

* Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations.
* Why?
    * Shared data sets
        * Decompose one large bucket policy into separate, discrete access point policies for each application that needs to access the shared data set.
    * Copy data securely
        * Between same-region access points.
    * Limit access to specific account IDs and VPCs
    * Provide a unique name within a region.

### Encryption
* Disabled by default
* SSE-S3
    * S3 managed keys
    * Reduce the cost of SSE by up to 99% by decresing request traffic from S3 to KMS.
* SSE-KMS
    * KMS managed keys
    * Choice between AWSKMS managed key (aws/s3) of a custiomer managed key.
    * Why use a customer managed key:
        *  You want to grant cross-account access to your S3 objects.
        *  You want to create, rotate, diable or grant access policies for the key.     
* To encrypt existing Amazon S3 objects use tghe Batch Operations Copy operation.


### Access Analyzer for S3

Alerts you to S3 buckets that are configured to allow access to anyone on the internet or other AWS accounts, including accounts outside of your organization.

## EFS

* Scalable file storage for multiple EC2 instances
* Totally elastic – once you’ve spun up an EFS instance, you can add add files without worrying about provisioning or disturbing your application’s performance.
* NFS compatible.
* Mount to EC2 or on-prem Linux server over DirectConnect.
* Can be accessed by multiple EC2 instances within a VPC.
* Create a mount target for each AZ that contains EC2 instances.
* Storage Classes:
    * Regional - High availability
        * EFS Standard.
        * EFS Standard IA (Infrequent Access).
    * One-Zone
        * EFS One Zone.
        * EFS One Zone IA.
* Automatic backups to S3 with AWS Backup.
* Lifecyle Management
    * None to 90 days since last access.
    * Moves infequently accessed files into IA.
* Performance Modes:
    * General purpose - latency sensitive use cases.
    * Max I/O - High throughput.
* Throughput modes:
    * Bursting
        * Throuput scales with the size of the file system.
        * Can burst to 100 MiB/s of metered throughput
    * Provisioned - Configure provisioned and max throuput.
        * Provisoned Throughput 1-1024 MIB/s.
        * Max throughput.
        * For applications with high throuput to storage (e.g. web server or CMS).

## FSx

* Windows File System compatible.

## EBS

* High performance, low latency, per instance block storage.
* For data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.
* In special cases, Amazon EBS Multi-Attach can turn EBS into multi-instance storage, like EFS.
* Either General Purpose SSD (for general use) or Provisioned IOPS SSD, for mission-critical workloads.

### EBS Snapshots

* Snapshots are incremental backups to S3.
* Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager can be used to manage snapshots.

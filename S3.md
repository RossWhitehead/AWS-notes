### Intelligent-Tiering Archive configuration

### S3 Glacier
* Files are stored as archives.
    * An archive can be up to 40TB.
* Archives are grouped in vaults.
* Event notifications can be enabled for the following job completion events:
    * Archive Retrieval Job Complete.
    * Vault Inventory Retrieval Job Complete.

### S3 Access Points
* Access points are named network endpoints that are attached to buckets that you can use to perform S3 object operations.
* Why?
    * Shared data sets
        * Decompose one large bucket policy into separate, discrete access point policies for each application that needs to access the shared data set.
    * Copy data securely
        * Between same-region access points.
    * Limit access to specific account IDs and VPCs
    * Provide a unique name within a region.

## EBS

* High performance, low latency, per instance block storage.
* For data that must be quickly accessible and requires long-term persistence.
* In special cases, Amazon EBS Multi-Attach can turn EBS into multi-instance storage, like EFS.
* Either General Purpose SSD (for general use) or Provisioned IOPS SSD, for mission-critical workloads.

### EBS Snapshots

* Snapshots are incremental backups to S3.
* Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager can be used to manage snapshots.
